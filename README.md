working through using F# with Nuke.Build (if it's at all possible)

## Issue 1 - refit stubs generated for F# project

Repro

* gen a new nuke project using the template
* minimize/reproduce that default template in F# as much as possible (not focused on working, just compiling/getting to a feedback loop)
* cd to `build-fs` and run `dotnet build`
* nuke packages are restored, build commences
* _something_ causes generation of a refit stub with the following content:

```csharp
// <auto-generated />
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Collections.Generic;

/* ******** Hey You! *********
 *
 * This is a generated file, and gets rewritten every time you build the
 * project. If you want to edit it, you need to edit the mustache template
 * in the Refit package */

#pragma warning disable
namespace build_fs.RefitInternalGenerated
{
    [global::System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]
    [AttributeUsage (AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Struct | AttributeTargets.Enum | AttributeTargets.Constructor | AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Property | AttributeTargets.Field | AttributeTargets.Event | AttributeTargets.Interface | AttributeTargets.Delegate)]
    sealed class PreserveAttribute : Attribute
    {

        //
        // Fields
        //
        public bool AllMembers;

        public bool Conditional;
    }
}
#pragma warning restore

```

* need to figure out what this is and disable it
